When the command "make -f Makefile-2" is entered, the make function compiles the program written in the target path. This target is achieved by describing the desired location inside a file. For example, in this particular command, make compiles the program written in "Makefile-2", which is this file. The "all" in this file refers to the target and everything following it are the dependencies.
